## The HTML DOM (Document Object Model)

https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp

When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page.

The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard:

> "The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM standard is separated into 3 different parts:

* Core DOM - standard model for all document types
* XML DOM - standard model for XML documents
* HTML DOM - standard model for HTML documents


The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:

The HTML DOM is a standard object model and programming interface for HTML. It defines:

* The HTML elements as objects
* The properties of all HTML elements
* The methods to access all HTML elements
* The events for all HTML elements
* In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard for how to get, change, add, or delete HTML elements.

### Interacting with the DOM using JavaScript

With the object model, JavaScript gets all the power it needs to create dynamic HTML:

JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page
