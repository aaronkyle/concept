## Exensions to d3.js

* [Crossfilter](http://crossfilter.github.io/crossfilter/)
    - Crossfilter is a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. Crossfilter supports extremely fast (<30ms) interaction with coordinated views, even with datasets containing a million or more records. This version of Crossfilter is a community fork of the original Crossfilter project developed by Square, Inc.

* [dc.js - Dimensional Charting Javascript Library](http://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/)
   - dc.js is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant feedback to user interaction.
   - dc.js is an easy yet powerful javascript library for data visualization and analysis in the browser and on mobile devices.
