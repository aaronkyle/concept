Looking to create visualizations of changing 'caseload' over time.

ONE.org' [online version](https://www.one.org/us/the-toughest-places-for-a-girl-to-get-an-education/) of [The Toughest Places For A Girl To Get An Education](https://s3.amazonaws.com/one.org/pdfs/IDG_2017_media_briefing_en_web.pdf), including a beautiful interactive pie chart of their index.

The [site was built on Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery/toughest-places-girl-get-education-2017), which currently makes it impossible for users to capture text from the image files and interactive graphics.
