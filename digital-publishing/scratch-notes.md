Through GitHub Pages, one can serve out pages with custom Javascript (such as rendering interactive graphs using d3) in a way that isn't so straight-forward with other popular OpenSource web publishing solutions (such as Wordpress).

To do this involves a bit of customization to the standard set of 'templates' offered via GitHub pages. That is, one can't just a link to d3 in one's `_includes/head.html` file and embed Javascript directly in a markdown-ified blog post: Jekyll (or maybe Liquid?) strips out the Javascript.

[Here's the workaround](http://blog.emmatosch.com/2016/03/09/using-custom-javascript-in-jekyll-blogs.html).
