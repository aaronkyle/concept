Through GitHub Pages, one can serve out pages with custom Javascript (such as rendering interactive graphs using d3) in a way that isn't so straight-forward with other popular OpenSource web publishing solutions (such as Wordpress).

To do this involves a bit of customization to the standard set of 'templates' offered via GitHub pages. That is, one can't just a link to d3 in one's `_includes/head.html` file and embed Javascript directly in a markdown-ified blog post: Jekyll (or maybe Liquid?) strips out the Javascript.

[Here's the workaround](http://blog.emmatosch.com/2016/03/09/using-custom-javascript-in-jekyll-blogs.html).

Part of publishing is ensuring that records are accurate, safe, and secure.  The contextual metadata attached to files (such as PDFs) is not always (read: rarely) accurate, and it is not always secure to publish metadata (such as locational data written into many smartphone images).

[EXIF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format) is a type of metadata that is embedded in photo files from most types of cameras and phones.

This metadata includes information about the device used to capture the photo, but also often includes the GPS coordinates of where the photo was taken.

Many users unknowingly share this information with the general public and site/app owners when uploading photos online.

This has been a common vector of privacy lapses, including cases where journalists have unintentionally published photos with GPS data intact.

Recent press has also revealed the NSA’s collection of EXIF data in its [XKeyscore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XKeyscore) program.


When working locally on file (i.e. on my computer), I can avail of Phil Harvey's [ExifTool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) to manipulate metadata.  For web publications, I need to perform these manipulations in another way.

Is EXIF without merit?

That’s certainly not the implication of this project. Metadata adds another dimension to photos and is valuable for preserving context. This project aims to educate and give users a choice in the matter of sharing it with specific services (and the web at large).
