WORK IN PROGRESS

Objective: To present complex annotated maps on the Internet.

Requirements: Include interactive features akin to google maps where layers are shown/hidden, features are highlighted and spatial analysis may be performed.

Solutions:

[QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/en/site/) is a tool that creates interactive map projects. The maps are presented and analysed within the QGIS tool. Its presentation is adequate for CCCS presentation but it needs to be presented on a web page rather than within the QGIS desktop.
