## About Geo-Mapping (for web and print)

### A Caveat:

This repository focuses on OpenSource solutions to web mapping.

There are, of course, other means of quickly creating production-quality maps, such as Mapbox, CartoDB, QGIS Cloud [which is based on an OpenSource stack], LizMaps and others.  While promoted as 'free', the un-paid licences for these systems only give users a rather meager amount of space or don’t include helpful tools. These services are terrific for learning web mapping and starting to build a portfoloi, but for full control one really needs to build a system from scratch.
