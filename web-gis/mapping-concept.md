I am firmly of the belief that mapping in particular has an enormous potential for adding value to data sets. 

Mapping with d3.js

d3.js includes powerful routines for handling geographical information.

In the same sense that a line graph is a simple representation of data on a document, a map can be regarded as a set of points with an underlying coordinate system (though far less trivial in practice--both for either the d3.js developers[^note](# "Mike Bostock has lauded the work of Jason Davies http://www.jasondavies.com/  and http://www.jasondavies.com/maps/ in the development of the latest major version of d3.js (version 3) for his work on improving mapping capability.") and those wishing to display a map).

The following collection of examples gives a brief taste of what has been accomplished by combining geographic information and D3 thus far.[^note2](# "Screen shots are been sourced from the biovisualize gallery http://biovisualize.github.com/d3visualization/#visualizationType=map and as such provide attribution to the best of my ability.
