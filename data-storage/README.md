## Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are great ways to store data.  Spreadsheets help people to organize information according to column and row formats that can be readily understood by data analytics software.

Using data stored in spreadsheets, however, is not without its difficultly.  To get at the data, analytics software must be able to open and parse the information.  This wasn't always easy. Each software applications (like MS Excel) has its specific way of storing and managing the information that you (the user) enters.  Although Microsoft Excel is widely supported, it took years for developers to 'integrate' with the MS ecosystem, as that system was closed by design.

Along the way, other systems has come along that replicate the functionality of MS document management utilities, including spreadsheets.  
Google Spreadsheets is a free, web-based spreadsheet.  It is 'free' in the sense of being un-paid (for now; this is threatend).  It is not 'free' in the sense that the software isn't OpenSource and the data are not yours to manipulate.

Toward free, open-source alternatives to Google Spreadsheets, a top contenders is [Only Office](#), though noteworthy also are [FengOffice](#).

Most spreasheet software can 'save' or 'export' to file formats of greater or lesser support for styling information.
